# VolatileChess

Currently working on prototype verison of the chess website that focuses on just making a normal game of chess that is ran localy and in the command promt.
Might add ability to make moves through post commands but this isn't our current goal.
We want to make sure we can set up the proper game logic for chess.
Due date week of Feb 15th maybe?
